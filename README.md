# Roblox Galaxy Perfect Warp 7.0

## IMPORTANT NOTE: A HIGHIER VERSION NUMBER DOES NOT MEAN IT'S BETTER. IT ONLY SIGNIFIES A DIFFERENT METHOD.

It is important that adjust the path to the music file accordingly.

One of the last Perfect Warp script made around October 2023.

Manual warp script with a timer-based formula that was made a joke using a beat drop to indicate when to warp. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQJeLEvHMtM.

The script is fairly simple. You can use the tools provided in the Perfect Warp 3.5 release.

6537 is the time in ms which represents the time taken to reach the beatdrop from the beginning of the audio.

Formula used:
ttw := Round(Log(Distance / 201.384) / Log(1.75959), 4)
Where distance is measured in studs (83000) and ttw is how long to let the warp charge in seconds. Keep in mind AHK sleep is measured in microseconds (ms).
